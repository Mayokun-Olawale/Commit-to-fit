Introduction
Anthony does not regularly go to the gym, but is looking to start. He would like to create an account so that he can track his workouts and share his workouts with his friends.

Tasks
Create account (5 mins): starting from the home page, create an account

Notes
Anthony was very quickly able to navigate to the sign up page. He also immediately knew to enter his information to complete the account creation process. Once his account was created, he also wanted to see what the website looked like while logged in.

User Feedback
Anthony described the sign up process as "pretty standard for how you make accounts with websites". He also described it as "very professional and straightforward". He did not list any confusions or potential improvements.

Results
Although Anthony did not experience any problems with the process, there is a potential redundancy within the website. Currently, the website only encourages users to sign up/log in. However, it could force them to stay on the sign up page, since the website doesn't work anyway if the user is not signed in, and the rest of the website would only tell them to sign in anyway.
