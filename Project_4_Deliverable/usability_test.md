Notes

Leadership Board
When given the homescreen, the participants first clicked on the activities button and scrolled down on the page, afterwards, they navigated to the home screen, before finally going to the community page and seeing the tab which says leadership board. A pain point that was highlighted during this was the placement of the leadership board, the participants gravitated towards the activities page instead of the community page.

User Feedback

MJ: She mentioned liking the overall look of the app and that many of the features were intuitive, however, she mentioned that placing the leadership board in the community page was not intuitive and also crowded the community page which already has 3 tabs. She also mentioned that she would love to use the leadership board to connect with people outside of her already established community, as leadership boards for other applications feature users from all over the world.


Results

Leadership Board
The user expressed confusion while navigating the application to the leadership board page, additionally the user expressed that they would prefer a leadership board that connected them with worldwide users instead of just current friends. To accommodate this feedback, the leadership board will be moved from within the community page to having its own page. Additionally, this page will now include 2 leadership boards: one which features the user and their friends, and 1 which features all users of the application. With these changes, the user will be able to navigate to the leadership board easier, view a leadership board containing users outside of current friends, and have a leadership board of users friends.
